       " '\\ufeffReligion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \"an order of existence\".    Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \"divine\",    \"sacred things\",    \"faith\",    a \"supernatural being or supernatural beings\"    or \"...some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\"       Religious practices may include rituals, sermons, commemoration or veneration  of God or deities , sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances, initiations, funerary services, matrimonial services, meditation, prayer, music, art, dance, public service, or other aspects of human culture. Religions have sacred histories and narratives, which may be preserved in sacred scriptures, and symbols and holy places, that aim mostly to give a meaning to life. Religions may contain symbolic stories, which are sometimes said by followers to be true, that have the side purpose of explaining the origin of life, the Universe, and other things. Traditionally, faith, in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs.    There are an estimated   ,    distinct religions worldwide.    About   % of the world  population is affiliated with one of the five largest religions, namely Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism or forms of folk religion.       With the onset of the modernisation of and the scientific revolution in the western world, some aspects of religion have cumulatively been criticized. Though the religiously unaffliated, including atheism  the rejection of belief in the existence of deities  and agnosticism  the belief that the truth of certain claims – especially metaphysical and religious claims such as whether God, the divine or the supernatural exist – are unknown and perhaps unknowable , have grown globally, many of the unaffiliated still have various religious beliefs.     About   % of the world  population is religiously unaffiliated.       The study of religion encompasses a wide variety of academic disciplines, including theology, comparative religion and social scientific studies. Theories of religion offer various explanations for the origins and workings of religion.',\n",
       " '\\ufeffLaw is a system of rules that are enforced through social institutions to govern behaviour.    Laws can be made by legislatures through legislation  resulting in statutes , the executive through decrees and regulations, or judges through binding precedent  normally in common law jurisdictions . Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including  in some jurisdictions  arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution  written or unwritten  and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.    A general distinction can be made between  a  civil law jurisdictions  including canon and socialist law , in which the legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates their laws, and  b  common law systems, where judge-made precedent is accepted as binding law. Historically, religious laws played a significant role even in settling of secular matters, which is still the case in some religious communities, particularly Jewish, and some countries, particularly Islamic. Islamic Sharia law is the world  most widely used religious law.       The adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas referred to as  i  Criminal law and  ii  Civil law. Criminal law deals with conduct that is considered harmful to social order and in which the guilty party may be imprisoned or fined. Civil law  not to be confused with civil law jurisdictions above  deals with the resolution of lawsuits  disputes  between individuals or organizations. These resolutions seek to provide a legal remedy  often monetary damages  to the winning litigant. Under civil law, the following specialties, among others, exist: Contract law regulates everything from buying a bus ticket to trading on derivatives markets. Property law regulates the transfer and title of personal property and real property. Trust law applies to assets held for investment and financial security. Tort law allows claims for compensation if a person  property is harmed. Constitutional law provides a framework for the creation of law, the protection of human rights and the election of political representatives. Administrative law governs what executive branch agencies may and may not do, procedures that they must follow to do it, and judicial review when a member of the public is harmed by an agency action. International law governs affairs between sovereign states in activities ranging from trade to military action. To implement and enforce the law and provide services to the public by public servants, a government  bureaucracy, military, and police are vital. While all these organs of the state are creatures created and bound by law, an independent legal profession and a vibrant civil society inform and support their progress.    Law provides a rich source of scholarly inquiry into legal history, philosophy, economic analysis and sociology. Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice. There is an old saying that \\'all are equal before the law\\'. In     , the author Anatole France said sarcastically, \"In its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets, and steal loaves of bread.\"    Writing in     BC, the Greek philosopher Aristotle declared, \"The rule of law is better than the rule of any individual.\"    Mikhail Bakunin said: \"All law has for its object to confirm and exalt into a system the exploitation of the workers by a ruling class\".    Cicero said \"more law, less justice\".    Marxist doctrine asserts that law will not be required once the state has withered away.   ',\n",
       " '\\ufeffPsychology is the study of mind and behavior.       It is an academic discipline and an applied science which seeks to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.       In this field, a professional practitioner or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.    Psychologists explore concepts such as perception, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, phenomenology, motivation, brain functioning, personality, behavior, and interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind.    Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, some—especially clinical and counseling psychologists—at times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a \"hub science\",    with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy.    While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society.       The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Many do scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior, and typically work in university psychology departments or teach in other academic settings  e.g., medical schools, hospitals . Some are employed in industrial and organizational settings, or in other areas    such as human development and aging, sports, health, and the media, as well as in forensic investigation and other aspects of law.',\n",
       " '\\ufeffAs used by lawyers and legal scholars, the phrase \"law and economics\" refers to the application of microeconomic analysis to legal problems. Because of the overlap between legal systems and political systems, some of the issues in law and economics are also raised in political economy, constitutional economics and political science.    Approaches to the same issues from Marxist and critical theory/Frankfurt School perspectives usually do not identify themselves as \"law and economics\". For example, research by members of the critical legal studies movement and the sociology of law considers many of the same fundamental issues as does work labeled \"law and economics,\" though from a vastly different perspective.    The one wing that represents a non-neoclassical approach to \"law and economics\" is the Continental  mainly German  tradition that sees the concept starting out of the governance and public policy  Staatswissenschaften  approach and the German Historical school of economics; this view is represented in the Elgar Companion to Law and Economics   nd ed.       and—though not exclusively—in the European Journal of Law and Economics. Here, consciously non-neoclassical approaches to economics are used for the analysis of legal  and administrative/governance  problems.',\n",
       " '\\ufeffQuantum mechanics  QM; also known as quantum physics, or quantum theory , including quantum field theory, is a fundamental branch of physics concerned with processes involving, for example, atoms and photons. In such processes, the action has been observed to be only in integer multiples of the Planck constant, a physical quantity that is exceedingly, indeed perhaps ultimately, small. It is said to be quantized. Other physical quantities change in corresponding discrete amounts. In the light of the laws of classical physics, this discreteness has no explanation, and seems perhaps mysterious. Moreover, it entails that the finest possible experimental preparation of a physical system is defined by quanta, and that the finest possible physical observation is of a single quantum. Physical measurements a priori, in classical terms, assume that continuous measurements are possible. Consequently, quantum phenomena can be accurately described only if the elementary processes are conceived as stochastic or probabilistic, averaging to provide continuous measurements. The vast numbers of elementary quantum effects involved in everyday macroscopic observations mean that discrete quantum behaviors are usually hidden by much larger statistical effects, as averages. Quantum mechanics often leads to classical mechanics in macroscopic situations.    Important applications of quantum mechanical theory include superconducting magnets, LEDs and the laser, the transistor and semiconductors such as the microprocessor, medical and research imaging such as MRI and electron microscopy, and explanations for many biological and physical phenomena.    Two fundamental quantum mechanical principles are wave-particle duality  quanta exhibit both \\'wave-like\\' behaviors such as refraction and \\'particle-like\\' behavior , the uncertainty principle  attempting to measure one attribute such as velocity or position may cause another attribute to become less measurable , and superposition and the status of the observer  a wave function superimposes multiple co-existing states that have different probabilities; observation causes collapse of the wave function to some specific state, in several interpretations, as in the famous example of Schrödinger  Cat .    Quantum mechanics gradually arose from Max Planck  solution in      to the black-body radiation problem  reported       and Albert Einstein       paper which offered a quantum-based theory to explain the photoelectric effect  reported      . Around     -    , the atomic theory and the corpuscular theory of light    first came to be widely accepted as scientific fact; these latter theories can be viewed as quantum theories of matter and electromagnetic radiation, respectively. Early quantum theory was significantly reformulated in the mid-    s by Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and Pascual Jordan  matrix mechanics ; Louis de Broglie and Erwin Schrödinger  wave mechanics ; and Wolfgang Pauli and Satyendra Nath Bose  statistics of subatomic particles . Moreover, the Copenhagen interpretation of Niels Bohr became widely accepted. By     , quantum mechanics had been further unified and formalized by the work of David Hilbert, Paul Dirac and John von Neumann    with greater emphasis on measurement, the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality, and philosophical speculation about the \\'observer\\'. It has since permeated many disciplines including quantum chemistry, quantum electronics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. Its speculative modern developments include string theory and quantum gravity theories. It also provides a useful framework for many features of the modern periodic table of elements, and describes the behaviors of atoms during chemical bonding and the flow of electrons in computer semiconductors, and therefore plays a crucial role in many modern technologies.    The mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are abstract. A mathematical function, the wave function, provides information about the probability amplitude of position, momentum, and other physical properties of a particle. Mathematical manipulations of the wave function usually involve bra–ket notation, which requires an understanding of complex numbers and linear functionals. The wavefunction formulation treats the particle as a quantum harmonic oscillator, and the mathematics is akin to that describing acoustic resonance. Many of the results of quantum mechanics are not easily visualized in terms of classical mechanics. For instance, in a quantum mechanical model, the lowest energy state of a system, the ground state, is non-zero as opposed to a more \"traditional\" ground state with zero kinetic energy  all particles at rest . Instead of a traditional static, unchanging zero energy state, quantum mechanics allows for far more dynamic, chaotic possibilities, according to John Wheeler.    The term \"quantum\" itself  plural: quanta  comes from the Latin word quantus meaning how much or as much as, referring to discrete units of change.',\n",
       " '\\ufeffLaw of India refers to the system of law in modern India. India maintains a common law legal system inherited from the colonial era and various legislations first introduced by the British are still in effect in modified forms today. During the drafting of the Indian Constitution, Indian laws also adhere to the United Nations guidelines on human rights law and the environmental law. Certain international trade laws, such as those on intellectual property, are also enforced in India.    Indian personal law is fairly complex, with each religion adhering to its own specific laws. In most states, registering of marriages and divorces is not compulsory. Separate laws govern Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, and followers of other religions. The exception to this rule is in the state of Goa, where a uniform civil code is in place, in which all religions have a common law regarding marriages, divorces, and adoption.    As of May     , there were about      laws.    However, since there are Central laws as well as State laws, it is difficult to ascertain their exact numbers as on a given date and the best way to find the Central Laws in India is from the official website',\n",
       " '\\ufeffhis article is about the religions that originated in the Indian subcontinent. For religious demographics of the Republic of India, see Religion in India.    Indian religions, also termed as Dharmic faiths or religions, are the religions that originated in the Indian subcontinent; namely Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. web    note    These religions are also classified as Eastern religions. Although Indian religions are connected through the history of India, they constitute a wide range of religious communities, and are not confined to the Indian subcontinent. web       Evidence attesting to prehistoric religion in the Indian subcontinent derives from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings. The Harappan people of the Indus Valley Civilisation, which lasted from      to      BCE  mature period,     –     BCE , had an early urbanised culture which predates the Vedic religion.       The documented history of Indian religions begins with the historical Vedic religion, the religious practices of the early Indo-Iranians, which were collected and later redacted into the Vedas. The period of the composition, redaction and commentary of these texts is known as the Vedic period, which lasted from roughly      to     BCE.       The Reform or Shramanic Period between    –    BCE marks a \"turning point between the Vedic religion and Hindu religions\".    The Shramana movement, an ancient Indian religious movement parallel to but separate from Vedic tradition, gave rise to Jainism    and Buddhism,    and was responsible for the related concepts of Yoga,    saṃsāra  the cycle of birth and death  and moksha  liberation from that cycle .    This period also saw the writing of the Upanishads and the rise of Vedanta.    The Puranic Period      BCE –     CE  and Early Medieval period     –     CE  gave rise to new configurations of Hinduism, especially bhakti and Shaivism, Shaktism, Vaishnavism, Smarta and much smaller groups like the conservative Shrauta.    The early Islamic period      –     CE  also gave rise to new movements. Sikhism was founded in the   th century on the teachings of Guru Nanak and the nine successive Sikh Gurus in Northern India. web    The vast majority of its adherents originate in the Punjab region.    With the colonial dominance of the British a reinterpretation and synthesis of Hinduism arose, which aided the Indian independence movement.',\n",
       " '\\ufeffGroup psychotherapy or group therapy is a form of psychotherapy in which one or more therapists treat a small group of clients together as a group. The term can legitimately refer to any form of psychotherapy when delivered in a group format, including Cognitive behavioural therapy or Interpersonal therapy, but it is usually applied to psychodynamic group therapy where the group context and group process is explicitly utilised as a mechanism of change by developing, exploring and examining interpersonal relationships within the group.    The broader concept of group therapy can be taken to include any helping process that takes place in a group, including support groups, skills training groups  such as anger management, mindfulness, relaxation training or social skills training , and psycho-education groups. The differences between psychodynamic groups, activity groups, support groups, problem-solving and psycoeducational groups are discussed by Montgomery       .    Other, more specialised forms of group therapy would include non-verbal expressive therapies such as art therapy, dance therapy, or music therapy.  The founders of group psychotherapy in the USA were Joseph H. Pratt, Trigant Burrow and Paul Schilder. All three of them were active and working at the East Coast in the first half of the   th century. After World War II, group psychotherapy was further developed by Jacob L. Moreno, Samuel Slavson, Hyman Spotnitz, Irvin Yalom, and Lou Ormont. Yalom  approach to group therapy has been very influential not only in the USA but across the world. An early development in group therapy the T-group or training group  sometimes also referred to as sensitivity-training group, human relations training group or encounter group  is a form of group psychotherapy where participants themselves  typically, between eight and    people  learn about themselves  and about small group processes in general  through their interaction with each other. They use feedback, problem solving, and role play to gain insights into themselves, others, and groups. It was pioneered in the mid-    s by Kurt Lewin and Carl Rogers and his colleagues as a method of learning about human behavior in what became The National Training Laboratories  now NTL Institute  that was created by the Office of Naval Research and the National Education Association in Bethel, Maine, in     . Moreno developed a specific and highly structured form of group therapy known as Psychodrama  although the entry on psychodrama claims it is not a form of group therapy . Another recent development in the theory and method of group psychotherapy based on an integration of systems thinking is Yvonne Agazarian  \"systems-Centered\" approach  SCT , which sees groups functioning within the principles of system dynamics. Her method of \"functional subgrouping\" introduces a method of organizing group communication so it is less likely to react counterproductively to differences. SCT also emphasizes the need to recognize the phases of group development and the defenses related to each phase in order to best make sense and influence group dynamics.    In the United Kingdom group psychotherapy initially developed independently, with pioneers S. H. Foulkes and Wilfred Bion using group therapy as an approach to treating combat fatigue in the Second World War. Foulkes and Bion were psychoanalysts and incorporated psychoanalysis into group therapy by recognising that transference can arise not only between group members and the therapist but also among group members. Furthermore, the psychoanalytic concept of the unconscious was extended with a recognition of a group unconscious, in which the unconscious processes of group members could be acted out in the form of irrational processes in group sessions. Foulkes developed the model known as Group Analysis and the Institute of Group Analysis, while Bion was influential in the development of group therapy at the Tavistock Clinic.    Bion  approach is comparable to Social Therapy, first developed in the United States in the late     s by Lois Holzman and Fred Newman, which is a group therapy in which practitioners relate to the group, not its individuals, as the fundamental unit of development. The task of the group is to \"build the group\" rather than focus on problem solving or \"fixing\" individuals.    In Argentina an independent school of group analysis stemmed from the work and teachings of Swiss-born Argentine psychoanalyst Enrique Pichon-Riviere. This thinker conceived of a group-centered approach which, although not directly influenced by Foulkes\\' work, was fully compatible with it.   ',\n",
       " '\\ufeffIn quantum mechanics and its applications to quantum many-particle systems, notably quantum chemistry, angular momentum diagrams, or more accurately from a mathematical viewpoint angular momentum graphs, are a diagrammatic method for representing angular momentum quantum states of a quantum system allowing calculations to be done symbolically. More specifically, the arrows encode angular momentum states in bra–ket notation and include the abstract nature of the state, such as tensor products and transformation rules.    The notation parallels the idea of Penrose graphical notation and Feynman diagrams. The diagrams consist of arrows and vertices with quantum numbers as labels, hence the alternative term \"graphs\". The sense of each arrow is related to Hermitian conjugation, which roughly corresponds to time reversal of the angular momentum states  c.f. Schrödinger equation . The diagrammatic notation is a considerably large topic in its own right with a number of specialized features – this article introduces the very basics.    They were developed primarily by Adolfas Jucys in the twentieth century.',\n",

       " '\\ufeffMany people who have sat through introductory physics courses in high school or college might disagree with the claim, \"Newtonian mechanics makes intuitive sense to us.\" They may remember the subject as a bewildering merry-go-round of pulleys and vectors and inclined planes, and think that \"intuitive sense\" is the last thing that Newtonian mechanics should be accused of making.    But while the process of actually calculating something within the framework of Newtonian mechanics--doing a homework problem, or getting astronauts to the moon--can be ferociously complicated, the underlying concepts are pretty straightforward. The world is made of tangible things that we can observe and recognize: billiard balls, planets, pulleys. These things exert forces, or bump into one another, and their motions change in response to those influences. If Laplace  Demon knew all of the positions and momenta of every particle in the universe, it could predict the future and the past with perfect fidelity; we know that this is outside of our capabilities, but we can imagine knowing the positions and momenta of a few billiard balls on a frictionless table, and at least in principle we can imagine doing the math. After that it  just a matter of extrapolation and courage to encompass the entire universe.    Newtonian mechanics is usually referred to as \"classical\" mechanics by physicists, who want to emphasize that it  not just a set of particular rules laid down by Newton. Classical mechanics is a way of thinking about the deep structure of the world. Different types of things--baseballs, gas molecules, electromagnetic waves--will follow different specific rules, but those rules will share the same pattern. The essence of that pattern is that everything has some kind of \"position,\" and some kind of \"momentum,\" and that information can be used to predict what will happen next.']"

    "like 'A', 'a', or '0', are the simplest regular expressions; they simply match themselves. You can concatenate ordinary characters, so last matches the string 'last'.<br>\n",

    "  .<br>(Dot.) Matches any character except a newline.<br>\n",
    "  ^<br>(Caret.) Matches start of the string<br>\n",
    "  $<br>(Dollar) Matches end of the string<br>\n",
    "  \\*<br>(Star) Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or more repetitions. ab* will match ‘a’, ‘ab’, or ‘a’ followed by any number of ‘b’s.<br>\n",
    "  \\+<br>Causes the resulting RE to match 1 or more repetitions of the preceding RE. ab+ will match ‘a’ followed by any non-zero number of ‘b’s <br>\n",

    "  []<br>Used to indicate a set of characters. In a set: Characters can be listed individually, e.g. [amk] will match 'a', 'm', or 'k'. Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-', for example [a-z] will match any lowercase ASCII letter, [0-5][0-9] will match all the two-digits numbers from 00 to 59, and [0-9A-Fa-f] will match any hexadecimal digit. Special characters lose their special meaning inside sets. For example, [(+*)] will match any of the literal characters  '(', '+', '*', or ')'. Character classes such as \\w or \\S are also accepted inside a set, Characters that are not within a range can be matched by complementing the set. If the first character of the set is '^', all the characters that are not in the set will be matched. For example, [^5] will match any character except '5'. ^ has no special meaning if it’s not the first character in the set.  To match a literal ']' inside a set, precede it with a backslash, or place it at the beginning of the set. <br>\n",
