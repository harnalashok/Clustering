Many people who have sat through introductory physics courses in high school or college might disagree with the claim, "Newtonian mechanics makes intuitive sense to us." They may remember the subject as a bewildering merry-go-round of pulleys and vectors and inclined planes, and think that "intuitive sense" is the last thing that Newtonian mechanics should be accused of making.

But while the process of actually calculating something within the framework of Newtonian mechanics--doing a homework problem, or getting astronauts to the moon--can be ferociously complicated, the underlying concepts are pretty straightforward. The world is made of tangible things that we can observe and recognize: billiard balls, planets, pulleys. These things exert forces, or bump into one another, and their motions change in response to those influences. If Laplace's Demon knew all of the positions and momenta of every particle in the universe, it could predict the future and the past with perfect fidelity; we know that this is outside of our capabilities, but we can imagine knowing the positions and momenta of a few billiard balls on a frictionless table, and at least in principle we can imagine doing the math. After that it's just a matter of extrapolation and courage to encompass the entire universe.

Newtonian mechanics is usually referred to as "classical" mechanics by physicists, who want to emphasize that it's not just a set of particular rules laid down by Newton. Classical mechanics is a way of thinking about the deep structure of the world. Different types of things--baseballs, gas molecules, electromagnetic waves--will follow different specific rules, but those rules will share the same pattern. The essence of that pattern is that everything has some kind of "position," and some kind of "momentum," and that information can be used to predict what will happen next.
