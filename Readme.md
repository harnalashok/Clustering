  <li><b><a href=https://github.com/harnalashok/Clustering/tree/master/graduate_admissions>Clustering graduate admissions dataset</a></b>: Utilizes Graduate Admissions Dataset from Unversities. Kmeans clustering is done. It so happens that clusters are aligned with who gets admitted and who does not.</li>

  <li><b><a href=https://github.com/harnalashok/Clustering/tree/master/gmm/Generating%20images%20using%20GMM>Generating digits and faces with Gaussian Mixture Model</a></b>: GMM is a generative model. Techniques of sample generation are used on mnist digits dataset and on olivetti faces dataset to generate new sample digits and new faces.</li>
